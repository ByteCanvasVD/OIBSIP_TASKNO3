<h3>3.Random Password Generator</h3>
 <b>Project Overview:</b>
  <p></p>This project uses Tkinter in Python to construct a password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI). Users of the password generator can alter the generated passwords by choosing several character kinds, including digits, symbols, lowercase and capital letters, and length. Users can copy the created password to the clipboard for convenience of use, and it can be shown in a popup window.</P>
<h3></h3>Implementation Details: </h3>
  <p>1. Importing Necessary Modules:<br>
     for the project by importing essential modules:<br>
     tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.<br>
     ttk: Provides themed widgets for a more modern look.<br>
     messagebox from tkinter: Enables the display of message boxes.<br>
     random: Used for generating random characters.<br>
     string: Provides constants for ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.<br>
     pyperclip: Used for clipboard integration.</p>
<h3>Flow of the Project:</h3><br>
      <p>Initialization: 1) The program starts by initializing the Tkinter GUI and creating the main window.<br>
                      2) GUI elements such as labels, entry widgets, checkboxes, and buttons are defined.<br>
                      3) Tkinter variables are created to store user input.<br>
 User Interaction:    1) Users input the desired password length and select character types through checkboxes.<br>
                      2)Users click the "Generate Password" button to initiate the password generation process.<br>
Password Generation:  1) The generate_password method checks user input and constructs a character set.<br>
                      2) A password is generated using random selection from the character set.<br>
                      3)The generated password is displayed in a popup window.<br>
Clipboard Integration: 1)Users can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.<br>
                       2)The copy_to_clipboard method ensures that a password has been generated before attempting to copy.</p>

<h3>Output Format: </h3><p></p>The generated password is displayed in a popup window using Tkinter's messagebox.showinfo. 
               If there are warnings or errors , warning message boxes are displayed using messagebox.showinfo.</p><br>
 <h3></h3>Conclusion:</h3> <p>This password generator project provides users with a user-friendly interface for generating secure passwords with customized complexity. The Tkinter GUI ensures ease of use, and the clipboard integration feature enhances convenience for users. The project follows a clear flow from user input to password generation and provides feedback through message boxes.</p>
